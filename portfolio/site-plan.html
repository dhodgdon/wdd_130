      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        I grew up in Lorton, Virginia, and am currently living in Rexburg, Idaho. I am a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and I had the opportunity to serve a full-time mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints from 2019-2021 in New York City and Connecticut. During my mission, I was able to help people improve their lives by growing their faith in God. I also had the opportunity to teach English and grow in my love of cultures and languages as I learned Portuguese, Spanish, and beginner’s French during my mission. Upon returning from my mission, I moved to Idaho to attend Brigham Young University–Idaho, which is where I met and married my sweetheart. I love spending time with my wife doing just about anything, reading, learning about cultures and languages (and everything else too!), cooking (and especially eating!), and talking (my wife can attest to this last one).
